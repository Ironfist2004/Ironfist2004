As autonomous cars become more prevalent, it is essential for these robots to understand what is happening around them.
To model the sensory input to the computers, ultrasonic sensors can be placed on an Arduino car.
The code controls the ultrasonic sensors and motors of the Ardunio car, telling it what to do if facing an obstruction.
